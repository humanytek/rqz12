Customs DIOT
============

TODO

In some cases there may be a difference between the amount of the customs and
the amount of the bill of customs.

When this happens, an auxiliary line is created on the invoice with the
difference amount.

To set up the accounting account to which that amount of difference will go:

Should create a system parameter ``Settings / Technical / System parameters``

The parameter must have the key ``customs_difference_account`` and the value
must be the id of the accounting account.

If this parameter does not exist, the invoice journal account will be use.
